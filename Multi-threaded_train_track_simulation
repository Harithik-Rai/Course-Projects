This program is a multi-threaded railway track simulator written in C, designed to emulate the scheduling of multiple trains sharing a common main track. It uses POSIX threads, mutexes, and condition variables to manage train loading, crossing, and priority-based scheduling, ensuring that only one train is on the main track at any given time while adhering to priority rules and avoiding starvation. The program reads train data from an input file, simulates their loading and crossing times, and outputs the sequence of events in a formatted manner.
